I'm a Junior .NET Developer passionate about building high-quality, scalable applications using modern technologies. I have a solid foundation in C#, ASP.NET, and SQL, and I'm always eager to deepen my knowledge and expand my skill set.

I enjoy working in collaborative, team-oriented environments where I can contribute to solving real-world problems — whether it’s debugging tricky issues, enhancing performance, or developing new features. I take pride in writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

I'm focused on growing my expertise in .NET development and related technologies, while staying open to learning new tools and frameworks that help build better software.
